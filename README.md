# Tiny-ImageNet-Image-Classification
This project explores the classification of the Tiny ImageNet dataset using various convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures and methodologies, including image augmentation and transfer learning.
Starting with simple three-layer CNNs and progressing to more sophisticated deep neural networks with and without dropout, we assess their performance in handling complex image classification tasks.
Subsequent experiments leverage pre-trained models like ResNet-50, highlighting the impact of deep architectures and ImageNet weights on performance.
The project culminates in a comparative analysis that demonstrates the superior efficacy of deeper networks with dropout and transfer learning strategies, contributing to the ongoing discourse on optimizing CNN architectures for enhanced image classification accuracy.
